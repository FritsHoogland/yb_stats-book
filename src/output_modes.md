# Output modes

The output that `yb_stat` provides can roughly be divided into 3 categories:
- Information that is obtained from stored snapshots, which is formatted for readability.
- Information that is obtained from the live cluster, which is formatted for readability.
- Raw output provided in a text file, which is obtained at snapshot time. This is not printed, the resulting file can be used.
