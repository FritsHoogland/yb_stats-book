# Output modes

The output that `yb_stat` provides can roughly be divided into 3 categories:
- Metrics / performance related output requiring two snapshots.
- Static output that provides the situation at the time of the snapshot.
- Raw output, which is a copy of provided information by the YugabyteDB endpoint.
