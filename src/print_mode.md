# Print modes

Outside of performance metrics, a snapshot contains a lot more information. 
Most of the additonal information can be obtained using print commands. 
All of the print commands take a single snapshot number, some print commands do accept no snapshot number, which makes `yb_stats` perform a live lookup.
